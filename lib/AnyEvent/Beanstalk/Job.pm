=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Beanstalk::Job - Class to represent a job from a beanstalkd server

=head1 VERSION

version 1.121460

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $client = AnyEvent::Beanstalk->new;

  my $job = $client->stats->recv;

  print $job->data,"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All communication methods called by this class to the server will call C<recv>
on the condition variable returned by L<AnyEvent::Beanstalk>. If this is undesired
then a call can be made directly to the server via methods on the client.

Note however that beanstalkd processes command in sequence. So if there is currently
a reserve request pending. Any calls to these methods will not return until the
reserve command has returned so that beanstalkd can process any subsequent commands.
